# Todo React Hooks

A simple TodoList project built with React + Vite demonstrating common Hooks:
- useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo
- custom hook: useLocalStorage (persist todos)
- add / edit / toggle / delete / search / clear completed

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- This is a minimal starter project suitable for interns to practice Hooks and small UI work.
- You can extend it with Axios, React Router, or tests.
